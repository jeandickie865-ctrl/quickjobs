The trajectory details an extensive, iterative UI/UX overhaul of the ShiftMatch application, driven by a German-speaking user providing specific code patches and design directives. The core goal was to unify the app's aesthetic under a consistent, modern, dark iPhone-style theme, referred to as the BACKUP design.

The work involved redesigning key authentication screens (, ), the main worker job feed (), and the entire five-step worker profile creation wizard ( through ). Each redesign was implemented via user-provided code, often requiring multiple attempts and debugging due to syntax errors or Metro bundler caching issues. The user emphasized specific UI constraints, such as buttons having a maximum width of 60% and ensuring an iPhone-friendly layout.

The most recent and current task focuses on refactoring the main worker profile editing screen, . After initially applying the new dark theme, the user found the long, single-page layout too cluttered for a mobile device. After a detailed discussion analyzing the risks of a multi-step approach versus a tabbed interface, the user and AI agreed that a Tab-based layout was the safer and preferred solution. The previous engineer was just about to begin this refactoring work.

<product_requirements>
The ShiftMatch application is a German-language, two-sided marketplace connecting Auftraggeber (Employers) and Auftragnehmer (Workers).

The primary product requirement has been to perform a complete visual and user experience overhaul of the application, migrating from an inconsistent purple/neon-green theme to a unified, modern, dark iPhone-style aesthetic, consistently referred to by the user as the BACKUP design.

**Key Implementation Requirements & Constraints:**
- **Consistent Dark Theme:** Apply a dark background (), dark cards (), and neon green accents () across all screens.
- **iPhone-Optimized Layout:** Ensure all layouts are clean and usable on an iPhone screen. This includes a user-specified constraint that primary action buttons should not exceed 60% of the screen width.
- **BACKUP Header:** A standardized header component with the text BACKUP and a neon underline should be used on key pages.

**Implemented Redesigns:**
- **Authentication:**  and  have been fully redesigned.
- **Worker Flow:**
    -  (Job Feed) has been redesigned.
    - The entire 5-step  has been redesigned with the BACKUP and BACKUP D+ (premium dark) themes.
    -  was redesigned, but the result was unsatisfactory, leading to the current refactoring task.
    - The worker tab navigator  was updated.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React Native with Expo.
- **Routing:** Expo Router (file-based).
- **Styling:**  for all styles. The BACKUP theme uses specific hex codes for dark backgrounds, cards, and neon accents.
- **State Management:** React , , and  for  and .
- **API Interaction:**  calls to a FastAPI backend for profile creation/updates, using a Bearer token from .
- **External Services:** OpenStreetMap (Nominatim) for address autocomplete.
- **Known Issue:** Frequent Metro bundler caching problems requiring manual cache clearing ([17:54:14] Starting project at /app/frontend) and server restarts to reflect changes.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The project is a standard Expo application with file-based routing in the  directory.



- ****
  - **Importance:** This is the main screen for a worker to edit their full profile after initial onboarding. It's a very large and complex file.
  - **Changes:** The file was completely replaced with a new BACKUP dark theme version. However, the user found the resulting single-scroll page too cluttered for an iPhone. The current task is to refactor this file to use a Tab-based interface to improve usability.

- ** (all files)**
  - **Importance:** This directory contains the 5-step onboarding flow for new workers.
  - **Changes:** Every file in this flow ( to ) was iteratively replaced with user-provided code to implement the new BACKUP and BACKUP D+ (dark premium) design, unifying the entire onboarding experience.

- ** & **
  - **Importance:** Core authentication screens for user entry and registration.
  - **Changes:** Both files were completely rewritten from an old purple theme to the new BACKUP dark theme, including animated elements and consistent input styling. This involved multiple debugging cycles to fix syntax and rendering errors.

- ****
  - **Importance:** The main job feed screen for workers.
  - **Changes:** Redesigned from an old purple/neon theme to the new BACKUP dark theme, including new card designs and layout.

- ****
  - **Importance:** The tab navigator for the entire worker section of the app.
  - **Changes:** The styling was updated with user-provided code to match the new BACKUP theme, ensuring consistent navigation aesthetics.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Redesign Worker Screens:** The  (view-only profile) and  pages still need to be updated to the BACKUP dark theme.
- **Redesign Employer Section:** The entire employer section, including , , and its , needs to be redesigned to match the new BACKUP theme.
- **Redesign Miscellaneous Screens:** Other screens, such as job detail pages, will likely need a design update for consistency.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The work is focused on refactoring the worker's main profile editing screen: .

Previously, the AI engineer had successfully replaced the entire file with a new version that applied the BACKUP dark theme. However, the user immediately pointed out that the resulting layout—a single, very long scrolling page with 5 distinct sections—was overwhelming and poorly suited for an iPhone (wieder so voll für iPhone).

A detailed discussion followed, where the AI engineer analyzed two potential solutions to improve the user experience:
1.  **Multi-Step Wizard:** Splitting the form into multiple pages, similar to the . This was deemed high-risk due to the complex state management required, especially for the interdependent category/subcategory logic.
2.  **Tabbed Interface:** Keeping all logic on one page but organizing the 5 sections into selectable tabs at the top. This was identified as a much safer, lower-risk approach that still achieved the goal of a cleaner UI.

The user explicitly agreed to the Tab-based approach. The last action by the previous engineer was to confirm this plan and prepare to start rewriting  to implement this new Tab-based structure.

User: Tabs funktionieren auch aber überleg erstmal ob das einfacher ist
AI: [Analysis of Tabs vs Multi-Step]... Ich habe die Optionen geprüft und kann mit Tabs beginnen.
User: ja dann mach die tabs
AI: Perfekt! Ich werde jetzt die mit Tabs umbauen. Das wird deutlich einfacher und sicherer! 🚀
