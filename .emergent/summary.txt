The trajectory documents a comprehensive development, debugging, and refactoring process for a German-language, two-sided job-matching mobile application. The user's primary language is German, and all subsequent interactions must be conducted in German.

The work began with a user-mandated, multi-step refactoring to centralize API communication into a new  file. This was necessary to fix systemic bugs caused by hardcoded backend URLs and inconsistent authorization headers across various  files. A major bug was the use of  instead of the correct , which was fixed in  and the legacy profile wizard.

A deeper authentication issue was then discovered: the backend was not correctly mapping tokens to user IDs. This was resolved by a significant backend refactoring in  to create a  collection in MongoDB for session management. Subsequently, the frontend's  was enhanced to validate tokens against the backend on app start-up, ensuring old, invalid sessions from  are cleared.

Throughout the process, multiple bugs related to frontend/backend payload mismatches (e.g.,  vs.  in chat,  vs.  in job creation) and missing security checks (cross-role authorization) were identified via extensive testing and fixed.

The most recent work involved multiple user-requested Safe Audits and Runtime Tests to verify the stability of the worker wizard, employer profile, and job creation flows. The final user request, which is the current task, is to perform a complete accessibility audit of the entire frontend.

<product_requirements>
The application is a German-language, two-sided mobile job marketplace connecting Auftraggeber (Employers) and Auftragnehmer (Workers).

**Core User Flows:**
*   **User Roles & Authentication:** Users register and log in as either an Employer or a Worker. The authentication system uses a custom token-to-userID mapping stored in a MongoDB collection on the backend. The frontend validates the session token on app start.
*   **Worker Profile Creation:** New workers must complete a multi-step profile wizard covering basic info, address, categories, and skills. This wizard was a major focus of debugging, particularly fixing an incorrect Authorization header that prevented profile saving.
*   **Job Management:** Employers can post jobs, specifying details like title, category, location (address object), and payment. This flow was debugged to fix a payload mismatch between the frontend and backend.
*   **Matching & Application:** Workers see a feed of jobs. The matching logic is currently client-side () and filters based on category and distance. Workers can apply for jobs.
*   **Matches & Communication:** An Employer accepting a Worker's application creates a Match. Matched users can communicate via a chat feature. The logic for displaying matches (filtering by ) was verified and confirmed correct.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) with Pydantic.
- **Database:** MongoDB, including a  collection for session management.
- **Frontend:** React Native with Expo.
- **Routing:** File-based routing via .
- **State Management:** React Context (), Zustand-like stores (, , etc.).
- **API Communication:** Refactored to use a centralized  for a single  URL and standardized  headers via .
- **Authentication:** Token validation on app-load in  to handle invalid sessions.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The project is a monorepo with  and  directories.



- ****
    - **Importance:** The core FastAPI backend. Contains all API endpoints, data models, and business logic.
    - **Changes:** Heavily modified. A  collection and associated logic were added to fix a fundamental authentication flaw. A security check was added to  to prevent cross-role data access. The  logic was verified to correctly reject other applications.

- ****
    - **Importance:** Centralizes all API communication logic. It provides , , and .
    - **Changes:** The  function was corrected to use the  for the  header, not the . This was a critical fix.

- ****
    - **Importance:** Manages the global authentication state (user, token).
    - **Changes:** Significantly updated to include token validation on app start. It now makes a test API call to ensure the stored token is valid on the backend; if not, it clears  to force a re-login.

- ****
    - **Importance:** The final step of the worker profile creation, responsible for saving the data.
    - **Changes:** Corrected to use the proper  header. Previously, it incorrectly used , which caused the profile saving to fail silently.

- ****
    - **Importance:** Manages chat functionality.
    - **Changes:** The  function was corrected to send a payload with a  key instead of  to match the backend's expectation, fixing the broken chat feature.

- ** & **
    - **Importance:** Core screens for the worker user.
    - **Changes:** Corrected to use  instead of the non-existent  for displaying addresses. Hints were also added to  to guide users with incomplete profiles.

<pending_tasks>
- **Complete the Accessibility Audit:** The primary pending task is to finish the comprehensive accessibility audit of the entire frontend, as requested by the user. This includes checking for missing s, contrast ratios, touch target sizes, and focus management.
- **Report Findings:** After the audit, a structured report detailing P1, P2, and P3 priority issues must be presented to the user.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was starting a comprehensive, analysis-only accessibility audit of the entire application, as explicitly requested by the user. This task was initiated after all major functional, security, and stability bugs (related to authentication, profile saving, and API communication) were resolved and verified through extensive testing.

The user's prompt was to analyze the app without making any changes and report on several key accessibility areas:
-   Missing  or  on interactive elements.
-   Contrast ratios (specifically the Purple/Lime theme) against WCAG-AA standards.
-   Minimum touch target sizes (44x44).
-   Focus management for screen readers, especially in modals.
-   Readability of form errors and success messages for assistive technologies.

The AI engineer had just begun **PHASE 1** of this audit, which involved analyzing the main UI components across the application to identify potential issues in these areas. The work is paused at the very beginning of this analysis phase.

<optional_next_step>
Continue the accessibility audit by analyzing the main components in files like , , and  to identify missing labels, contrast issues, and other accessibility violations.
