The trajectory documents a comprehensive, user-driven UI/UX overhaul of the ShiftMatch application. The user, who is German-speaking, has been systematically providing complete code replacements for each screen to migrate the app from an old purple theme to a new, consistent dark BACKUP theme.

The process is highly iterative:
1.  The AI engineer suggests the next logical screen to redesign (e.g., payment, chat, job details).
2.  The user agrees and asks to see the current file.
3.  The AI reads and displays the file.
4.  The user provides a complete, new code snippet for that file with the BACKUP design.
5.  The AI overwrites the old file with the new code, restarts the Expo server, and confirms completion.

This pattern has been successfully applied to numerous screens, including the worker profile wizard, authentication, feed, employer dashboard, job creation, job details, applications list, payment flow, and chat.

The most recent task was to redesign the  modal. The user provided an improved code snippet that not only applied the dark theme but also enhanced the logic for displaying data. The AI has just finished implementing this change and restarting the frontend. The next tasks, as identified, are the remaining employer profile screens.

The user's primary language is German. The next agent must respond in German only.

<product_requirements>
The ShiftMatch application is a German-language, two-sided marketplace connecting Auftraggeber (Employers) and Auftragnehmer (Workers).

The primary product goal is a complete visual and user experience overhaul. The objective is to migrate every screen from an inconsistent purple/lila theme to a unified, modern, dark iPhone-style aesthetic, consistently referred to as the BACKUP design.

**Core Design Specifications:**
*   **Theme:** Dark background (), dark cards (), and neon green accents ().
*   **Layout:** Clean, mobile-first layouts optimized for iPhone, with specific constraints like buttons having a maximum width of 60%.

**Implementation Status:**
The redesign is nearly complete. The AI engineer, guided by user-provided code, has successfully updated the following key areas to the BACKUP theme:
*   Authentication (, )
*   Worker Section (, , , tab layout)
*   Employer Section (, , , , , tab layout)
*   Core Functionality (, , various modals)

The project is in its final stages of this redesign phase, with only a few secondary employer-side screens remaining.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend Framework:** React Native with Expo.
- **Routing:** Expo Router (file-based routing within the  directory).
- **Styling:**  with a hardcoded BACKUP color palette. No CSS-in-JS or utility-class libraries are used.
- **State Management:** Primarily React Hooks (, , ) and  for .
- **Data:** A central  file is used for categories, skills, and qualifications across the app.
- **API:**  calls to a FastAPI backend, with authentication via a Bearer token.
</key_technical_concepts>
<code_architecture>
The project follows a standard Expo Router structure, where files in the  directory define the application's routes.



- ****
  - **Importance:** This is a crucial modal for employers to view a worker's detailed profile before or after a match.
  - **Summary of changes:** This file was the subject of the most recent work. It was completely replaced with user-provided code that not only applied the BACKUP dark theme but also included significant logic improvements for displaying masked names and resolving taxonomy labels.

- ****
  - **Importance:** A modal used in the job creation flow to ensure employers agree to legal terms.
  - **Summary of changes:** The file was rewritten to match the BACKUP theme. The AI also identified and fixed a potential infinite loop risk in the  logic by adding a  for a safer state update.

- ** & **
  - **Importance:** These are the core screens for an employer to create a new job and view the details of an existing one, including the list of applicants.
  - **Summary of changes:** Both were very large, complex files that were completely rewritten with user-provided code to implement the BACKUP dark theme, replacing all old UI components and styles.

- ****
  - **Importance:** The central communication screen for matched workers and employers.
  - **Summary of changes:** Rewritten from a purple theme to a BACKUP dark theme with a WhatsApp-style bubble layout, including dark-mode-friendly input fields and message bubbles.

- ****
  - **Importance:** The critical screen where an employer pays the platform's commission to unlock a match.
  - **Summary of changes:** Completely redesigned with the BACKUP dark theme, including payment method selection and an animated success screen.

<pending_tasks>
- **Redesign Employer Profile Screens:**
  -  (View-only profile)
  -  (Profile editing form)
- **Redesign Registration/PDF Flow:** The four screens under .
- **Redesign Job Rating Screen:** .

The user has explicitly asked to work on the employer profile screens next.

<current_work>
The most recent task was a complete redesign of the **** component. This is a modal that allows employers to view a worker's full profile.

The user provided a complete code snippet for this component. This snippet went beyond a simple theme change; it included:
1.  **BACKUP Dark Theme:** All colors and styles were updated to match the application's new dark design ( background,  cards, etc.).
2.  **Improved Logic:** The user's code introduced helper functions to better handle data display, such as  to show a masked name () before a match is confirmed and the full name after. It also improved how taxonomy labels for skills and categories were resolved.

The previous AI engineer recognized these improvements, validated the code, and successfully overwrote the old component file with the new, enhanced version. The final action taken was restarting the Expo frontend service to apply the changes. The work on this specific file is concluded.

<optional_next_step>
Ask the user for the design code for the two remaining employer profile screens:  and , as this was their last explicit request before the modal redesign.
