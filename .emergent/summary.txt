My analysis of the trajectory indicates the user's primary language is German, and all subsequent responses must be in German.

The previous AI engineer's work involved a significant number of feature additions and bug fixes on a React Native (Expo) job matching application. The initial request was to add a date/period selection for hourly jobs. This was successfully implemented in  and the corresponding worker view.

However, this led to a cascade of user-reported issues and new requests. Key developments include:
1.  **Backup & Environment Confusion:** The engineer initially struggled to locate the working directory, discovering that  was an archive, not a folder. All work was subsequently performed in the main  directory, with backups being created and files copied between the backup and working directories.
2.  **UI/UX Enhancements:** A Matches button with a notification badge was added to both employer and worker profile pages, and its visibility was fixed to show even with zero matches. Stray debug buttons were removed to clean up the UI.
3.  **Critical Bug Fixes:** The matching function repeatedly failed, which was traced to an empty . The engineer added a debug helper to create test jobs. A critical bug preventing employers from seeing applications was fixed by adding a missing  function in . The contact details display was also fixed.
4.  **Core Logic Refactoring:** The job matching logic was refactored multiple times for reliability, finally settling on a simplified version (). A full review system was also implemented.
5.  **Deployment Issues:** The final phase involved trying to deploy the application. This failed due to issues in the dormant Python backend, specifically a  caused by an incorrect  environment variable format that Pydantic could not parse. The engineer identified this as the root cause just before the session ended.

The application is a German-language, two-sided job marketplace connecting Auftraggeber (Employers) and Auftragnehmer (Workers).

**Core Functionality:**
*   **User Roles:** Users can act as either an Employer or a Worker.
*   **Job Posting (Employer):** Employers post jobs with details like category, skills, and payment. A key recent feature is the ability to specify a single date or a date range for hourly jobs.
*   **Worker Profiles:** Workers create profiles with skills, bio, photo, and contact details. These details are crucial for matching.
*   **Matching & Application:** The app uses a category-based algorithm to match workers to jobs. Workers can then apply via their feed. A recent simplification of the matching logic was implemented to improve reliability.
*   **Hiring & Payment:** Employers review applicants and can hire one, which leads to a mock payment screen. After payment, the match is confirmed.
*   **Contact Exchange & Chat:** Upon a successful match, contact details (phone, email) are exchanged, and a chat becomes available.
*   **Review System:** Both parties can rate each other after a job is completed. A rating marks the job as completed and prevents further applications.

The entire application state (jobs, profiles, applications, reviews) is managed on the client-side using , meaning there is no centralized database, and each user's experience is isolated to their device/browser.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Data Persistence**:  is the exclusive database for all app data (jobs, profiles, applications, reviews).
- **Frontend Framework**: React Native with Expo.
- **Navigation**: File-based routing using , including layouts and dynamic routes.
- **State Management**: Primarily React's  and  hooks, with  for user session management.
- **Core Logic**: Data is managed through a series of utility files in  (e.g., , , , ).
- **Styling**: Custom  objects create a NEON theme (purple/lime green).

<code_architecture>
The project is a monorepo containing a  (Expo) and an inactive  (FastAPI). All recent work was performed in the  directory, which was restored from a backup. A backup now exists at .



- ****:
    - **Importance**: This file contains the simplified, core job-matching logic. It was created to replace a more complex, error-prone version.
    - **Changes**: It was created and integrated into the worker's feed to provide a more reliable matching experience based solely on the job category.

- ****:
    - **Importance**: Manages the creation and retrieval of job applications.
    - **Changes**: A critical bug was fixed by adding the  function, which was missing, preventing employers from ever seeing their applicants.

- ****:
    - **Importance**: This is where employers see workers they've hired.
    - **Changes**: It was updated to fetch and display the worker's full contact details (, , , ) after a match, fixing a bug where no details were visible.

- ****:
    - **Importance**: Allows workers to manage their data, which is essential for matching.
    - **Changes**: Input fields for  and  were added so workers could provide this information. A debug button for the matching analysis tool was also added.

- ** and **:
    - **Importance**: Although the backend is inactive, its configuration was breaking the containerized deployment process.
    - **Changes**: An incorrect attempt to fix CORS by setting  in  and parsing it with  in  caused a . This is the immediate problem to be solved.
</code_architecture>
<pending_tasks>
- **Fix Deployment Blocker**: Correct the  configuration in the backend to resolve the  that is preventing deployment.
- **Display Ratings on Profiles**: Implement the UI to show a user's average rating on their profile when they appear in job listings or applicant lists. The backend logic () is partially there, but the UI was not completed.
- **Remove Matching Debug Tools**: The  screen and its corresponding button on the worker profile should be removed once matching is confirmed to be stable.

The engineer was in the final stages of debugging a failing Emergent deployment. The deployment logs clearly indicated the backend was failing to start due to an error in parsing environment variables.

**Root Cause Identified**: A  wrapping a  for the field .

**The Faulty Code**:
1.  In , the value was set to .
2.  In , the setting was defined with a Pydantic type that expected a list of strings, and a previous fix attempted to parse it with .

The combination of Pydantic's type expectations and the raw string  in the  file caused the JSON decoder to fail, as it was expecting a value like a JSON array (e.g., ).

The very last action taken by the previous engineer was correctly identifying this mistake with the message: **DAS WAR MEIN FEHLER! Mein CORS-Fix hat das Deployment kaputt gemacht! ... Ich fixe das SOFORT**. The work stopped immediately before the fix was implemented.

Fix the  parsing error in the backend to unblock deployment. This will involve modifying  and/or .
