The trajectory details a high-intensity, iterative debugging process conducted primarily in German. The initial goal was to fix core application functionalities like profile saving and photo uploads in a React Native (Expo) and FastAPI application.

The process began with diagnosing and fixing fundamental infrastructure and configuration issues. This included correcting container networking problems by adjusting the  in  and , and modifying  to correctly prefix API calls with . A major discovery was that AWS S3 was not configured, leading to a pivot where the AI implemented a local file upload system as a user-requested alternative ().

The focus then shifted to a series of rapid-fire bug fixes on the frontend, specifically within the Employer user flow. The user reported numerous UI and functionality problems. The AI addressed these by:
1.  Fixing broken authentication routing and logic in .
2.  Correcting a broken layout and navigation in the employer section ().
3.  Resolving multiple bugs in the job creation form (), including removing duplicated UI elements (for qualifications and address fields) and fixing type errors ( vs. ).
4.  Implementing  in the employer's job list () to ensure new jobs appear after creation.

The trajectory concludes with an unresolved critical bug: in the job creation form, the  component fails to populate the postal code field when a user selects an address suggestion. The AI's last action was to add extensive console logging to trace the state update and guide the extremely frustrated user on how to access the browser console to provide the necessary debugging information.

The user's primary language is German. The next agent must respond in German only.

<product_requirements>
The application, BACKUP, is a full-featured, two-sided mobile marketplace designed to connect Auftraggeber (Clients/Employers) and Jobstarter (Workers). It is not an MVP and is intended as a complete product.

**Core Requirements:**
*   **Dual User Roles:** Distinct registration, login, profile, and functional flows for Employers and Workers. The UI must clearly differentiate between these roles.
*   **Employer Flow:** Employers must be able to create, publish, and view their jobs (Aufträge). The job creation form requires fields for title, description, address (with autocomplete), compensation, and qualifications.
*   **Worker Flow:** Workers have a detailed, editable profile where they can upload a photo and select skills from a multi-level taxonomy.
*   **Navigation & UX:** The application must have persistent, intuitive navigation (e.g., a tab bar) allowing users to access key areas like their profile (with a logout function) from any screen.
*   **Visual Identity:** The app must adhere to a Neon-Tech theme with a purple background and neon-lime accents.

The development so far has focused heavily on stabilizing the Employer flow, specifically the job creation and listing functionality, after fixing major infrastructure and authentication issues.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React Native, Expo, Expo Router, Axios.
- **State Management:** React Context API (), , .
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI.
- **Data Storage:**
    - **Client-side:**  is used for caching data like jobs ().
    - **Server-side:** A local file system is used for photo uploads () as an alternative to AWS S3.
- **APIs:** OpenStreetMap API for address autocomplete.
- **Infrastructure:** Containerized environment (likely Docker/Kubernetes) where  routes are proxied to the backend service.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The project is a monorepo with a  (Expo) and  (FastAPI) structure.



- ****
    - **Importance:** This is the screen for creating new jobs and has been the source of many recent bugs. It integrates the problematic address component.
    - **Changes:** Heavily modified to remove duplicated UI sections for Qualifikationen and address fields. Corrected a type error, changing state and imports from the non-existent  type to the correct  type. Extensive  statements were added to debug state updates from child components.

- ****
    - **Importance:** This is the component causing the current critical issue. It's responsible for address search and autocomplete using the OpenStreetMap API.
    - **Changes:** Multiple attempts were made to fix a bug where selecting a suggestion fails to update the postal code in the parent component's state. The latest change involved reordering state-setting logic and adding detailed  statements to trace the  function's execution and the data it receives.

- ****
    - **Importance:** This screen lists the jobs created by the employer. It was failing to display newly created jobs.
    - **Changes:** Fixed an import error ( to ). Implemented the  hook to force a re-fetch of jobs from  whenever the screen comes into focus, ensuring the list is up-to-date.

- ****
    - **Importance:** This file defines the tab-based navigation for the employer section. Users were getting stuck on pages without access to the main tabs.
    - **Changes:** The layout was corrected to ensure the three main tabs (Meine Aufträge, Erstellen, Profil) are always visible, providing persistent navigation across the employer flow.

- ** & **
    - **Importance:** These files define the core data structures for the application.
    - **Changes:** The agent confirmed the  type exists and the  type does not, which was the source of a critical bug in  and . The  type was also verified.

<pending_tasks>
- **Fix Address Autocomplete:** The highest priority is to resolve the bug where the postal code is not being set when an address suggestion is selected in .
- **Document Upload System:** Implement a feature for workers to upload documents.
- **Payment Flow:** Implement a Stripe-based payment system.
- **Real-time Chat:** Build a WebSocket-based chat system.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was actively debugging a persistent and frustrating bug in the  component within the employer's job creation form ().

**The Problem:** When a user types an address and selects a suggestion from the dropdown (e.g., Am Stadtpark, 10, 40699, Erkrath), the City field (Erkrath) is correctly populated in the form, but the Postal Code field (40699) remains empty.

**Last Actions:**
1.  The AI made several attempts to fix this within , including reordering the sequence of callback calls and state updates in the  function.
2.  To definitively diagnose the issue, the AI implemented comprehensive logging in both  (to log the data extracted from the OSM API response) and  (to log whether the state update callback is being triggered and what value it receives).
3.  The user had trouble finding the browser console. The AI provided detailed, platform-specific instructions on how to open it.
4.  The user then provided a console log, but it contained a repeated React error () and not the specific debugging logs the AI had added.
5.  The AI's final action was to patiently re-instruct the user to ignore the errors, perform the address selection again, and look specifically for the new log messages prefixed with emojis (📍, 📮) that would trace the data flow from selection to state update. The process is currently stalled, awaiting this specific console output from the user.

<optional_next_step>
Wait for the user to provide the specific  output from the browser console after selecting an address. Analyze the logs to determine why the postal code state is not updating and then implement the correct fix.
