The trajectory details a complex and fraught debugging session conducted primarily in German. The initial goal was to fix three specific bugs: an incorrect wage display, an overly strict job matching algorithm, and a failing worker profile save mechanism. The AI correctly identified the causes for the wage and matching bugs and implemented fixes. For the profile saving, it correctly interpreted the user's request to move to a stable  solution and refactored the worker profile screen accordingly, removing backend dependencies.

However, a major regression occurred: the user was unable to log in with an email containing a hyphen. The AI's debugging process for this was extensive. It first (correctly) identified a backend Pydantic validation issue but then discovered a more fundamental problem: a failing PostgreSQL connection. This led to a critical, unconfirmed architectural decision: to eliminate the backend dependency for authentication entirely. The AI completely rewrote the  to rely solely on , mirroring the change made to the worker profile.

Despite these extensive changes, the user reported that the original problems (profile saving and matching) persisted. The AI's final action was to pivot to a pure debugging strategy by creating a utility () and adding a debug button to the UI to dump  state to the console. The session concluded with the AI instructing the user on how to provide these crucial logs.

The user's primary language is German. The next agent must respond in German only.

<product_requirements>
The application, BACKUP, is a two-sided mobile marketplace connecting Auftraggeber (Employers) and Jobstarter (Workers).

**Core Functionality:**
*   **Dual User Roles:** The app supports separate registration and feature sets for Employers and Workers.
*   **Employer Flow:** Employers can post job listings with details like title, address, and compensation. They can view job details and matched workers.
*   **Worker Flow:** Workers create a profile with their address, search radius, and skills. They can view a feed of available jobs.
*   **Matching System:** A critical feature that matches workers to jobs based on skills and geographic proximity.

**State of Implementation & Current Requirements:**
The application is in a highly unstable state. The user's explicit and sole requirement is to fix the existing, broken functionality, **not** to add new features. After a series of attempted fixes, the core authentication and profile management systems have been architecturally shifted to rely exclusively on , removing previous backend dependencies. However, the primary goals remain unachieved: profile saving and job matching are still reported as non-functional. The immediate task is to stabilize the application and make these core features work as intended.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React Native, Expo, Expo Router (file-based routing), TypeScript.
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Python (Largely bypassed in the latest changes).
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Connection is failing), **AsyncStorage** (Now the primary data store for auth and profiles).
- **State Management:** React Context (), .
- **APIs:** OpenStreetMap (Nominatim) for address geocoding.
- **Authentication:** Shifted from a JWT/backend model to a client-side, -based system.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The project is a monorepo with  and  directories. The architecture has been significantly altered to favor client-side persistence due to backend instability.



- ****
  - **Importance:** Manages the application's authentication state. It is central to the user's experience.
  - **Changes:** This file was **completely rewritten**. All backend API calls (, ) were removed. The , , and  functions now interact exclusively with  to manage user sessions, effectively making authentication a client-side-only process. The previous, backend-dependent version was saved as .

- ****
  - **Importance:** The screen where workers create and edit their profile, which is critical for the matching logic.
  - **Changes:** This file was heavily refactored to remove its reliance on the backend. The  function no longer calls . Instead, it uses a local utility ( from ) to save the profile data to . Most recently, a **debug button** (a red bug icon) was added, which triggers a function from  to log  contents to the console.

- ****
  - **Importance:** A new utility file created to aid in debugging the persistent issues.
  - **Changes:** Created to house functions for inspecting the application's state. It currently contains , which iterates through all keys in  and logs them to the console.

- ****
  - **Importance:** A new utility for managing the worker profile in .
  - **Changes:** Created to abstract the logic for saving and loading the worker profile from , replacing the previous backend API calls.

- ****
  - **Importance:** Displays the list of jobs available to the worker. It contains the core matching filter logic.
  - **Changes:** The filtering logic was updated to correctly call the  function on every job. The wage display was also fixed to use . However, the user reports it still doesn't find matches, indicating the problem lies deeper.

- ****
  - **Importance:** Defines the data models for authentication on the backend.
  - **Changes:** The Pydantic  validator was replaced with a more lenient custom regex to allow hyphens in domain names. This change is now largely moot since the frontend no longer uses the backend for authentication.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Diagnose and Fix Profile Saving:** The user reports that saving the worker profile still fails, and no success alert is shown. The root cause needs to be identified using the newly implemented debug logs.
- **Diagnose and Fix Job Matching:** The user reports that no matches are found in the worker feed, even after the matching logic was supposedly fixed. This requires a deep dive into the data stored in  for both jobs and the worker profile.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI is in a critical debugging phase, attempting to resolve why the core features of profile saving and job matching are still failing after extensive refactoring. The primary architectural model has been shifted to -only for auth and profiles, but this did not solve the issues.

The last action was to equip the application with better diagnostic tools. A new utility file, , was created. This utility is triggered by a new red bug icon button added to the worker profile screen ().

The immediate goal is to get information from the user. The AI has just restarted the Expo server and has instructed the user to:
1.  Open the browser's developer console.
2.  Navigate to the worker profile screen.
3.  Click the new debug button.
4.  Copy and paste the entire console output.

The work is paused, awaiting this crucial diagnostic information from the user to understand the state of  and identify the root cause of the persistent failures.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Analyze the console logs provided by the user after they click the new debug button to diagnose the state of  and pinpoint the failures in the profile saving and job matching logic.
