The trajectory documents an intensive, user-guided development process for the ShiftMatch mobile app. The user, a German-speaking engineer, has directed the AI through a wide range of tasks, from UI/UX enhancements and critical bug fixes to complex performance optimizations and a grueling iOS build-and-deployment cycle.

Work began with specific UI fixes, such as implementing a non-blocking toast notification. It then transitioned to debugging critical backend and frontend integration issues, including a stopped backend, a data-mapping error ( vs. ), and a major job-matching failure caused by inconsistent  files between the frontend (English keys) and backend (German keys). The AI successfully synchronized these to resolve the matching problem.

Performance was significantly improved on the  screens for both workers and employers by parallelizing sequential API calls using . The  component was also heavily optimized with debouncing, caching, and request guards.

The latter half of the trajectory was dominated by a difficult and iterative process to create a successful iOS build for TestFlight. This involved debugging numerous failures related to Expo SDK versions (downgrading from 54 to 53, then upgrading back to 54), Node.js version incompatibilities, CocoaPods errors (, , , ), and incorrect project configurations (hardcoded  in , missing ). After many failed attempts, a successful build was finally produced.

The most recent task, initiated right at the end, is to fix UI issues on the employer dashboard: a non-functional Aufträge button and a tab bar positioned too low on modern iPhones.

The user's primary language is German. All future responses **must be in German**.

<product_requirements>
The ShiftMatch application is a German-language, two-sided mobile marketplace connecting freelance/employed workers (Worker) with employers (Employer). The primary goal is to build a polished, stable, and performant app with a modern dark theme (BACKUP) and a native iOS feel.

**Core User Requirements:**
1.  **Worker & Employer Flows:** Users must be able to register, manage their profiles, and interact with the job lifecycle.
2.  **Job Matching:** Workers should see a feed of relevant jobs based on their profile (skills, location, radius). This matching must be reliable.
3.  **UI/UX Excellence:** The application must be visually consistent and handle device-specific UI challenges like the iPhone's safe areas and keyboard. All interactions should be smooth and intuitive.
4.  **Performance:** List screens, particularly Matches, must load quickly, even with a large number of entries.
5.  **Deployment:** The application must be buildable for iOS (TestFlight) and Android, requiring correct configuration of , , and all related dependencies.

**Implementation So Far:**
- The core application structure is in place using Expo Router.
- Numerous UI/UX refinements have been made (toasts, button states, layout fixes).
- Critical bugs related to data mapping (/), authentication, and job matching have been resolved.
- Performance of key list screens has been drastically improved.
- A successful iOS build was produced after an extensive debugging cycle.

- ** & **
  - **Importance:** Key screens for users to view their job matches. Were suffering from severe performance issues.
  - **Summary of Changes:** Reworked to use  to parallelize multiple API calls (for unread counts, worker profiles, registration status), drastically reducing load times. A conditional button was also added to the employer view to show Warten auf Worker-Daten if a worker's registration data is incomplete.

- ** & **
  - **Importance:** A critical bug was caused by the backend using a  with German keys () while the frontend used English keys (), breaking the job matching.
  - **Summary of Changes:** The backend's  was replaced with the frontend's version, and a migration script was run on the database to update all existing job categories to use English keys, unifying the system.

- ****
  - **Importance:** A reusable component for address search used in multiple screens.
  - **Summary of Changes:** Significantly optimized by adding debouncing (300ms delay), response caching (10-minute TTL), and a request ID guard to prevent race conditions, leading to a much faster and more responsive user experience.

<pending_tasks>
- **Fix Aufträge Button:** The user reported that the Aufträge (Jobs/Orders) button in the employer's tab navigation is not functional. This has not been investigated yet.
- **Verify Footer Fix:** The AI has applied a potential fix for the employer tab bar being too low, but the frontend service needs to be restarted and the result confirmed by the user.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI was actively debugging two UI issues reported by the user on the employer side of the application ( layout).

1.  **Non-functional Aufträge Button:** The user stated they are unable to press the Aufträge (Jobs/Orders) tab in the employer's main navigation. This part of the problem has not yet been addressed.
2.  **Incorrect Footer/Tab-Bar Position:** The user reported that the tab bar is positioned too low on their iPhone 16 Pro, with elements appearing at the very bottom edge of the screen.

The AI correctly identified this as a -related issue. It investigated the layout definition file for the employer section:
- **File:** 

It found hardcoded style values in the :

The AI deduced these values were insufficient for the larger safe area of modern iPhones and applied a fix:

The very last action was the intention to restart the Expo development server to apply this change. The investigation into the non-functional button has not yet begun.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Restart the Expo frontend server to apply the tab bar style changes, and then ask the user to verify if the footer position is now correct on their iPhone 16 Pro.
</optional_next_step>
