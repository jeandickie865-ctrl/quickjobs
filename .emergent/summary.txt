The user's primary language is German. All future responses must be in German.

The trajectory chronicles a comprehensive debugging and feature-building process for a React Native (Expo) job matching application. The initial task was to fix a non-functional job matching and profile saving system, which relied entirely on . The engineer successfully diagnosed and resolved these issues, which were caused by browser-incompatible  calls and inconsistent user ID generation.

As core functionality was restored, the user requested significant feature enhancements: adding a short bio to worker profiles, redesigning the employer's applicant view, and implementing a mock payment flow. During this phase, numerous UI/UX bugs and navigation issues were identified and fixed, including incorrect routing with , styling problems (invisible stars), and broken chat navigation. The UI was progressively refined to a NEON theme, and all user-facing strings were translated to German (Auftraggeber, Auftragnehmer).

A critical turning point occurred when the user inquired about multi-user testing. The engineer realized the -only architecture was a fundamental blocker, as users on different devices could not interact. A hybrid approach to re-introduce a dormant FastAPI backend was attempted but led to authentication errors (401) and an unstable state. Following the user's explicit instruction, the engineer rolled back all backend changes, reverting to the stable, pure  version.

Finally, a complete and clean backup of the project was created in . The last task, now in progress within this backup directory, is to implement a new feature: allowing employers to specify a date or date range for hourly jobs.

<product_requirements>
The application is a two-sided marketplace designed to connect Auftraggeber (Employers) and Auftragnehmer (Workers) in Germany.

**Core Functionality:**
1.  **Dual Roles:** Users can register and operate as either an Employer or a Worker.
2.  **Job Creation (Employer):** Employers can post jobs, specifying details like title, category, payment, and required skills. A key feature request is to add more flexibility for hourly jobs, allowing employers to specify a single date or a date range.
3.  **Profile Management (Worker):** Workers create detailed profiles including contact information, a profile photo, a short bio, work radius, and selectable skills/qualifications from a predefined taxonomy. The profile UX was recently improved to a sequential, accordion-style flow for better mobile usability.
4.  **Matching & Application:** The app matches workers to jobs based on category, skills, and location (radius). Workers see matching jobs in their feed and can apply.
5.  **Hiring Flow (Employer):** Employers review applicants, view their basic profiles (photo, bio), and can select one.
6.  **Payment & Match Confirmation:** Upon selecting a worker, the employer is directed to a mock payment screen that simulates a 20% platform fee. After the mock payment, the match is confirmed, and the chat becomes available.
7.  **Communication:** A built-in chat allows matched employers and workers to communicate.

The entire application currently operates without a central backend, using the device's  as the sole database. This enables a fully functional single-user demo but prevents multi-user interaction. A future goal is to migrate this logic to a live backend to enable true marketplace functionality.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Data Persistence**:  is the exclusive database for all application data, including user profiles, jobs, applications, and chats.
- **Frontend Framework**: React Native with Expo.
- **Navigation**: File-based routing using , including group routes  and dynamic routes . Navigation issues were a recurring theme, fixed by using correct pathing (e.g.,  instead of ).
- **Styling**: A custom NEON theme (purple and lime green) is applied throughout the app using . No external UI libraries are used.
- **Image Handling**: Profile photos are converted to Base64 data URIs and stored in .

<code_architecture>
The project is a monorepo, but all work occurs in the  directory. A backup of the entire stable project now exists at , and all new work is being done there.


- ****:
    - **Importance**: The screen where employers create new jobs. It's the entry point for new data into the system.
    - **Summary of Changes**: This file is the target of the . State variables (, , ) were added to support flexible date selection for hourly jobs. The UI is being modified to include radio buttons and date pickers for this new functionality.

- ****:
    - **Importance**: Handles the critical step of an employer hiring a worker.
    - **Summary of Changes**: This file was heavily debugged. A major bug was fixed where it was calling a non-existent function ( instead of ). The navigation logic after successful payment was also corrected multiple times, finally landing on a stable .

- ****:
    - **Importance**: This is where workers see the status of their applications.
    - **Summary of Changes**: Initially, it only showed 'accepted' matches. It was updated to show 'pending' applications as well, providing crucial feedback to the user. A Jobdetails button was re-added after being accidentally removed.

- ****:
    - **Importance**: The central hub for the worker's data, which is critical for the matching algorithm.
    - **Summary of Changes**: Underwent a major UX overhaul to implement a sequential, accordion-style UI for selecting categories and skills, making it much more usable on mobile. A My Matches button with a notification badge was also added.

- ****:
    - **Importance**: This directory is a complete, stable snapshot of the entire application before the major architectural change (re-introducing a backend) was attempted. **All future development must happen within this directory.**

<pending_tasks>
- **Display New Date Fields**: Show the newly captured date/period for hourly jobs on the Worker's job detail screen.
- **Backend Migration**: The fundamental task of migrating from a pure  architecture to a client-server model with a central database (MongoDB) remains. This is necessary for multi-user testing and production.

<current_work>
The immediate task is the implementation of a new feature within the backup directory (). The user requested more flexibility for creating hourly jobs (Stundenpaket).

**File Being Modified**: 

**Specific Changes in Progress**:
1.  **State Management**: New state variables have been added to the  component to manage the choice of date flexibility and the selected dates:
    
2.  **UI Implementation**: The engineer was in the process of adding the UI elements (likely radio buttons and conditional date pickers) to the JSX of the component to allow the employer to choose between:
    *   Kein spezifisches Datum (Any Date)
    *   An einem bestimmten Tag (A Specific Day)
    *   In einem Zeitraum (In a Date Range)
3.  **Data Persistence**: The next step after implementing the UI is to ensure these new date values are correctly saved as part of the job object when the form is submitted.

The work was paused just after adding the new UI logic, with a final step of ensuring colors were correctly defined and the data would be saved.

<optional_next_step>
Continue implementing the UI for the flexible date options in , ensuring the new data fields (, , ) are correctly saved to the job object upon creation.
