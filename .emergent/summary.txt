The trajectory documents the final, complex stages of a complete UI/UX overhaul for the ShiftMatch application, migrating it from a purple theme to a consistent dark BACKUP theme. The user, who is German-speaking, guides the process with specific requests and, at times, full code snippets.

The work cycle involved:
1.  **Redesigning Components:** The AI successfully converted , , , and  to the dark theme.
2.  **Bug Fixing & Feature Refinement:** A significant portion of the trajectory focused on the  screen. This involved a protracted and difficult process of implementing a fixed bottom action button that is now visible and correctly positioned above the tab bar. The AI also fixed an unreadable text issue in  and added two crucial coordinate-handling buttons to  after installing .
3.  **User-AI Interaction:** The interaction is highly iterative. The user provides precise feedback, including screenshots and code, and the AI implements the changes. There were several instances of misunderstanding, such as the AI modifying the wrong file, which were quickly corrected upon user feedback.

The most recent task, initiated by the user, is to fix the worker-side tab bar, which is currently unreadable and contains incorrect labels. The AI has acknowledged this and is about to locate the relevant layout file.

The user's primary language is German. All future responses must be in German.

<product_requirements>
The ShiftMatch application is a German-language, two-sided marketplace connecting employers and workers. The core product requirement is a complete visual and user experience overhaul of the entire application.

**Objective:** Migrate every screen from an old, inconsistent purple theme to a unified, modern, dark BACKUP theme, optimized for a professional, native iPhone-style aesthetic.

**Core Design Specifications:**
*   **Theme:** Dark background (), dark cards (), and neon green accents ().
*   **Layout:** Clean, mobile-first layouts with specific constraints, such as action buttons having a maximum width of 60% and being correctly anchored for one-handed use.
*   **Language:** Labels and text must be in German.

**Implementation Status:**
The redesign is in its final stages. Key sections like authentication, worker/employer dashboards, job creation/details, payment, and chat have been migrated. The most recent work focused on fixing complex layout issues on the job creation screen and redesigning several worker-side pages. The current task is to fix the worker-side tab bar navigation, which has styling and labeling issues.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Framework:** React Native with Expo
- **Routing:** Expo Router (file-based)
- **Styling:**  with a hardcoded BACKUP theme color palette.
- **State Management:** React Hooks (, ) and  for context.
- **Layout Pattern:** A recurring and critical challenge was implementing a fixed bottom action button. The final, working solution involves a combination of ,  (to clear the tab bar), and , with careful parent container flex properties.
- **Device API:**  was installed and used for GPS functionality.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The project uses a standard Expo Router file-based routing structure.



- ****
    - **Importance:** This is the critical screen for employers to post new jobs. It was the source of significant layout problems.
    - **Summary of Changes:** The file underwent numerous, iterative changes to fix a non-visible action button. The final solution places a button container with  and  to keep it fixed above the tab bar. The button's width is capped at 60%. The file's theme was also changed from a user-provided Premium Purple back to the standard BACKUP dark theme.

- ****
    - **Importance:** This screen shows workers the details of a specific job.
    - **Summary of Changes:** The entire screen was converted from the old purple theme to the BACKUP dark theme. The main action button (Ich habe Zeit) was styled to have a 60% width to maintain consistency with the rest of the app.

- ****
    - **Importance:** Shows a worker a list of their job applications and their statuses.
    - **Summary of Changes:** Following a specific user request, the AI performed an incremental, style-only update to convert the screen to the BACKUP dark theme without rewriting the file's structure.

- ****
    - **Importance:** A reusable component for address input and geocoding.
    - **Summary of Changes:**  was installed. Two buttons were added: Aktueller GPS-Standort (uses device GPS) and Koordinaten berechnen (performs forward geocoding from the typed address). The buttons were later styled to have 60% width and no emojis for a cleaner look.

- ****
    - **Importance:** Displays the cost breakdown for a job.
    - **Summary of Changes:** A simple but important fix was made to change the text color from  to  (white) to make it readable on the dark theme.

<pending_tasks>
- **Fix Worker Tab Bar:** The immediate task is to redesign the worker tab bar () for readability, remove the Matches old tab, and rename the all/jobs tab to alle Jobs.
- **Redesign Remaining Employer Screens:** The profile (), edit profile (), registration, and job rating screens are still pending the BACKUP theme redesign.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on fixing the worker-side tab bar navigation. The user reported that the footer navigation is poorly designed and unreadable on the dark theme.

**User's Explicit Requests for the Tab Bar:**
1.  **Fix Design:** The styling needs to be adjusted to be angemessen designed (appropriately designed) so the labels are visible against the dark background.
2.  **Remove Matches old:** This tab is considered unnecessary and should be removed from the navigation.
3.  **Rename Tab:** The tab labeled all/jobs must be renamed to its German equivalent, alle Jobs, for consistency with the app's language.

The previous AI engineer acknowledged these issues and was in the process of locating the correct file to modify, which is conventionally  in an Expo Router setup. The work stopped just before reading or editing this file.

**User:** guck dir mal den die fusszeile an, können wir die bitte angemessen designed so sieht man ja nichts auch brauchen wir ja Matches old nicht, und es soll NICHT all/jobs dort stehen sondern alle Jobs nicht englisch

**AI:** Verstanden! Die Tab-Bar unten sieht schrecklich aus. Lassen Sie mich die Worker Tab-Navigation finden und anpassen:
