The trajectory details an intensive, user-guided development process for a React Native application named BACKUP. The user, communicating in German, directed the AI engineer through building a full-stack application.

Initially, the work focused on scaffolding a complete FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, and Alembic to replace the existing -based mock data system. This involved significant debugging, including installing PostgreSQL when it was missing and correcting database configurations. The AI iteratively refined the backend models (, , ) based on precise user feedback, fixing issues like mutable array defaults () and adding Pydantic validation.

Subsequently, the focus shifted to implementing core business logic. A full application and matching flow was architected, including creating  and  modules. The AI successfully implemented the backend for workers applying to jobs and employers selecting workers. It also integrated a photo upload feature for worker profiles using a new S3 service.

The most recent and critical work involved intensive frontend UI debugging. After integrating new backend-driven screens, the user reported a black screen. The AI correctly diagnosed and fixed hardcoded background colors. When the user requested the app's signature purple theme, the AI updated the global theme file. This led to a new issue: unreadable white text on white UI cards. The AI correctly identified this final problem and was in the process of patching the text colors on the affected screens when the trajectory ended.

The user's primary language is German. The next agent must respond in German only.

<product_requirements>
The application, BACKUP, is a two-sided mobile marketplace connecting Auftraggeber (Clients/Employers) and Jobstarter (Workers). The core requirement is to build a polished, full-stack application with a consistent Neon-Tech visual identity, defined by a BACKUP Purple () background and BACKUP Neon () accents.

**Key Features Implemented & In-Progress:**
*   **Architecture:** Migrated from a frontend-only prototype using  to a full-stack application with a FastAPI backend and a PostgreSQL database managed by SQLAlchemy and Alembic.
*   **User Roles & Authentication:** Secure JWT-based registration and login for distinct Employer and Worker roles.
*   **Profiles:**
    *   **Worker:** Includes name, address, matching criteria (categories, qualifications, activities), and a profile photo uploaded to Amazon S3.
    *   **Employer:** Includes company name, address, and matching criteria. The photo feature was explicitly removed for employers.
*   **Job & Application Flow:**
    *   Employers can create, view, update, and delete jobs.
    *   Workers can view job details and apply (Ich habe Zeit).
    *   Employers can view a list of applicants for their jobs and select a worker, which updates the application status.
*   **Taxonomy:** A detailed, fixed taxonomy of 14 categories with 82 activities and 77 qualifications is defined in the frontend and used for matching logic.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React Native, Expo, Expo Router, , .
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Python, SQLAlchemy (async ORM), Alembic (migrations), Pydantic (validation).
- **Database:** PostgreSQL.
- **Authentication:** JWT with  password hashing.
- **File Storage:** Amazon S3 for photo uploads via .
- **Styling:** A custom  and  file for global theming.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The project is a monorepo with  (Expo) and  (FastAPI) directories.



- ****: The FastAPI application.
    - ****: A new service created to handle file uploads to an Amazon S3 bucket using . It validates file type and size.
    - **, **: These modules were heavily modified. The SQLAlchemy models were updated to use  for  fields and make timestamps non-nullable. Schemas were improved with  and Pydantic validators.
    - **, **: Newly created modules to handle the job application and worker selection flow. They contain SQLAlchemy models, Pydantic schemas, and FastAPI routers with business logic (e.g., workers apply, employers select).
    - ****: Contains multiple Alembic migration files that reflect the iterative changes to the , , , and  tables, including adding/removing columns and creating new tables.
- ****: The Expo React Native application.
    - ****: The central theme definition file. It was edited multiple times during a debugging session to change the app's background from light-gray to purple () and the default text color to white ().
    - ****: A new, central Axios-based service for all backend API communication. It handles sending the auth token and includes functions for , , , etc.
    - ****: This screen was updated to include an S3 photo upload feature, using  and the new  service. It was also a key file in the theming debug, where its text color was being patched.
    - ****: A new screen created to list a worker's job applications by calling the  endpoint.
    - ****: A new screen for employers to view all applicants for a specific job, including their profile photos and details, with a button to select them.

<pending_tasks>
- **Document Upload System:** Implement the full backend logic and frontend UI for workers to upload documents (PDF, JPG) to S3, as per the user's detailed request.
- **Payment Flow:** Implement the Stripe-based payment system for the 20% platform commission after a match is made.
- **Real-time Chat:** Build the WebSocket-based chat system for communication between matched employers and workers.
- **Advanced Matching Logic:** Integrate the more advanced scoring logic from  into the main matching endpoints.

<current_work>
The most recent task was fixing a critical UI/theming issue. After the user requested a BACKUP Purple theme, the AI changed the global background color in  to  and the global text color to . This immediately caused a usability problem: on screens with white content cards (like the worker profile), the white text became unreadable against the white card background.

The user pointed this out (die ganze seite ist zerschossen), and the AI correctly diagnosed the white-on-white text issue. It began patching the affected screens to use a dark text color for content inside white cards. The AI successfully patched the  screen. The last action was an intent to apply the same fix to all other affected screens, specifically mentioning the job detail screens. The work was interrupted immediately after patching the first screen and before patching the others. All new screens (, , ) were using hardcoded colors and were patched to use the theme, which surfaced the final white-on-white issue.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Continue fixing the UI by applying the text color patch to the remaining screens that have white cards, such as  and , to ensure text is readable.
