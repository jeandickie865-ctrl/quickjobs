The trajectory reveals a complex series of bug fixes, feature implementations, and intense debugging sessions on a German-language React Native (Expo) job matching app. The user's primary language is German, and future interactions must be in German.

The work began by addressing a user-reported white screen issue, which was correctly identified as an intended complete profile screen for new users. Following a user-approved plan, I fixed a backend CORS deployment blocker, removed debug tools, and implemented a user rating system.

Subsequent user requests led to significant UI/UX improvements, including creating separate read-only and edit views for both worker and employer profiles. During this, a critical bug was discovered and fixed where worker qualifications and activities (tags) were not being saved, breaking the core matching logic.

The most challenging phase involved a prolonged, unsuccessful attempt to resolve a white screen error on the Expo Go mobile client, which worked fine in the web preview. This led through a dependency hell of React Native and Expo SDK version mismatches. After exhausting all options and consulting the support agent, it was concluded that the issue stemmed from platform limitations within the development environment.

Pivoting based on this, the user made a final, decisive request: abandon the local mobile preview issues and migrate the entire application from its client-side  architecture to a centralized MongoDB backend to enable true multi-user functionality for deployment. The work concluded immediately after acknowledging this new primary directive.

<product_requirements>
The product is a German-language, two-sided mobile job marketplace connecting Auftraggeber (Employers) and Auftragnehmer (Workers).

**Core Functionality:**
*   **User Roles:** Users register as either an Employer or a Worker.
*   **Job & Profile Management:** Employers post jobs, and Workers create detailed profiles including skills, bio, and qualifications (tags).
*   **Matching & Application:** The app matches workers to jobs based on categories and skills. Workers apply to jobs in their feed.
*   **Hiring & Reviews:** Employers can hire applicants. After a job, both parties can rate each other.

**Architectural Evolution:**
The application was initially built with all data (jobs, profiles, applications, reviews) stored locally on the client's device using . This made it a single-user experience.

**Current Mandate:**
The primary requirement has shifted. The application must be refactored to support multiple users concurrently. This involves a full migration of the data persistence layer from  to a centralized MongoDB database.  should only be used for storing the authentication token. This will make the app scalable and ready for a production deployment where users on different devices can interact.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Data Persistence (Legacy):**  for all application data (jobs, profiles, etc.).
- **Data Persistence (Target):** MongoDB for centralized, multi-user data storage.
- **Frontend:** React Native with Expo and file-based routing via .
- **Backend:** A minimal FastAPI server () connected to MongoDB, which will be expanded.
- **State Management:** React Context API () for authentication and / for component-level state.
- **Data Stores:** A collection of utility files () that previously managed  operations and must be refactored to make API calls.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The project is a monorepo with a  (Expo) and a  (FastAPI). The architecture was significantly refactored to support view/edit modes and is now slated for a migration to a centralized database.



- ****
  - **Importance:** This file was the source of a critical bug preventing worker skills (tags) from being saved, which broke the matching feature.
  - **Changes:** It was heavily refactored to correctly handle state updates for selected skills, use the correct data source (), and fix the logic for loading and saving profile data.

- ** & **
  - **Importance:** These files were created to provide a much-requested read-only view of a user's profile, improving UX.
  - **Changes:** Created from the original profile edit screens. They now display profile data and contain logic to redirect to the edit screen if a profile is incomplete. The worker version was updated to show detailed selected skills.

- ****
  - **Importance:** Defines all frontend dependencies.
  - **Changes:** Underwent numerous changes during the attempt to fix Expo Go compatibility issues, including upgrades and downgrades of , , and

- **Full MongoDB Migration:** The primary and only pending task is to convert the application from a single-user, -based app to a multi-user, database-driven app. This involves:
    1.  Creating API endpoints in the FastAPI backend for all CRUD operations (jobs, profiles, applications, reviews).
    2.  Rewriting all data stores in  to use  to call these new API endpoints instead of .

[08:44:17], and . After multiple failed attempts, and based on feedback from the support agent, we concluded this was a platform limitation of the development environment's Expo Go integration, not a code issue that could be resolved.

Following this realization, the user made a strategic decision to pivot away from fixing the local preview and to focus on the most critical architectural flaw of the application: its lack of multi-user support.

The very last action was the user giving the explicit command to migrate the entire application's data persistence from client-side  to a centralized MongoDB database. I acknowledged this request and was preparing to begin this major refactoring task. All previous work on UI/UX and bug fixing is complete and stable in the web preview. The focus is now entirely on this backend and data-layer migration.

Begin the MongoDB migration by creating the necessary backend API endpoints and refactoring the corresponding frontend data store. I will start with , as it is a core piece of functionality.
